# Image Filtering Application

üñºÔ∏è This is a Python code that implements an image filtering application using Streamlit. The application allows you to upload an image and apply various image filtering techniques.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- streamlit
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- scipy

## Link 
You can test the application following this link : [https://filtreimage.streamlit.app/](https://filtreimage.streamlit.app/) (Please wake up the application if you find it asleep)

## Usage

1. Save the script in a file, e.g., `image_filtering_app.py`.
2. Run the script using the following command:

   ````shell
   streamlit run image_filtering_app.py
   ```

3. The application will start, and you can access it through the provided URL.
4. Upload an image by clicking on the "T√©l√©charger une image" button.
5. The application will display the original image, along with the filtered images.
6. The filtering options available are:

   - üìä **Bruit poisson**: Applies poisson noise to the image.
   - üñºÔ∏è **Image filtr√©e 3x3**: Applies median filtering with a window size of 3x3.
   - üñºÔ∏è **Image filtr√©e 5x5**: Applies median filtering with a window size of 5x5.
   - üñºÔ∏è **filtre 7x7**: Applies median filtering with a window size of 7x7.
   - üñºÔ∏è **filtre 11x11**: Applies median filtering with a window size of 11x11.

7. The filtered images will be displayed side by side with the original image.
